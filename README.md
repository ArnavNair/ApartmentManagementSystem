# **APARTMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

 This Application will be primarily used to manage all the short term and long term rental transactions for each of the apartment buildings managed under an Apartment Management company. This application is aimed to cater to the needs of both the Owner and the tenant to manage apartments and apply for apartments respectively.

The software is divided into three main sections. 

**1)TENANTS**
  Tenants section is meant to offer information regarding tenants’ lease contracts and payments.

**2)OWNERS**
  Owners section is a simple portal for the owners to check the status of their properties along with the payments and revenues.

**3)ADMINS**
  Portal for properties’ administrators. In this section the admin can add properties to the portfolio, manage lease contracts/rents, payments, owners and tenants. All the users (tenants and owners) are created by the administrator.

**Tools and technologies used**

**HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** - Basic skeleton and styles for the frontend.

**ReactJS** - JavaScript library used to build the rest of the frontend in terms of components, as mentioned in the previous section. Also captures and passes on the user’s requested actions to the backend.

**Node.js and Express.js** - Backend runtime environment and library respectively. They accept user requests from the frontend that either require routing to another page or DB interaction.

**Mongoose** - Basically a MongoDB middleman library, that acts as an interface between the backend and the MongoDB instance.

**MongoDB** - A NoSQL DBMS(used here in SQL form) that provides functionality to store data and perform all types of searches and updations.

**MLab** - Online MongoDB platform that contains the DB instance.

**Firebase** - Online web development framework, used here for login authorization through rudimentary verification.
